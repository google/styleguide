    <STYLEPOINT title="Which Shell to Use">
      <SUMMARY>
        <code>Bash</code> is the only shell scripting language permitted for
        executables.
      </SUMMARY>
      <BODY>
        <p>
          Executables must start with <code>#!/bin/bash</code> and a minimum
          number of flags. Use <code>set</code> to set shell options so that
          calling your script as <code>bash <i>&lt;script_name&gt;</i></code>
          does not break its functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Restricting all executable shell scripts to <b>bash</b>
          gives us a consistent shell language that's installed on all our
          machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only exception to this is where you're forced to by whatever
          you're coding for. One example of this is Solaris SVR4 packages which
          require plain Bourne shell for any scripts.
        </p>
      </BODY>
    </STYLEPOINT>

    <STYLEPOINT title="When to use Shell">
      <SUMMARY>
        Shell should only be used for small utilities or simple wrapper
        scripts.
      </SUMMARY>
      <BODY>
        <p>
          While shell scripting isn't a development language, it is used for
          writing various utility scripts throughout Google.  This
          style guide is more a recognition of its use rather than
          a suggestion that it be used for widespread deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some guidelines:
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you're mostly calling other utilities and are doing relatively
              little data manipulation, shell is an acceptable choice for the
              task.
            </li>
            <li>
              If performance matters, use something other than shell.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you find you need to use arrays for anything more than
              assignment of <code>${PIPESTATUS}</code>, you should use Python.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you are writing a script that is more than 100 lines long, you
              should probably be writing it in Python instead. Bear in mind
              that scripts grow. Rewrite your script in another language
              early to avoid a time-consuming rewrite at a later date.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </BODY>

</OVERVIEW>

<CATEGORY title="Shell Files and Interpreter Invocation">

  <STYLEPOINT title="File Extensions">
    <SUMMARY>
      Executables should have no extension (strongly preferred) or a
      <code>.sh</code> extension.
      Libraries must have a <code>.sh</code> extension and should not be
      executable.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        It is not necessary to know what language a program is written in when
        executing it and shell doesn't require an extension so we prefer not to
        use one for executables.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, for libraries it's important to know what language it is and
        sometimes there's a need to have similar libraries in different
        languages. This allows library files with identical purposes but
        different languages to be identically named except for the
        language-specific suffix.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="SUID/SGID">
    <SUMMARY>
      SUID and SGID are <em>forbidden</em> on shell scripts.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        There are too many security issues with shell that make it nearly
        impossible to secure sufficiently to allow SUID/SGID.  While bash does
        make it difficult to run SUID, it's still possible on some platforms
        which is why we're being explicit about banning it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use <code>sudo</code>  to provide elevated access if you need it.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

</CATEGORY>

<CATEGORY title="Environment">

  <STYLEPOINT title="STDOUT vs STDERR">
    <SUMMARY>
      All error messages should go to <code>STDERR</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        This makes it easier
        to separate normal status from actual issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        A function to print out error messages along with other status
        information is recommended.
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          err() {
            echo "[$(date +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z')]: $@" &gt;&amp;2
          }

          if ! do_something; then
            err "Unable to do_something"
            exit "${E_DID_NOTHING}"
          fi
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

</CATEGORY>

<CATEGORY title="Comments">

  <STYLEPOINT title="File Header">
    <SUMMARY>
      Start each file with a description of its contents.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Every file must have a top-level comment including a brief overview of
        its contents.
        A 
        copyright notice
        and author information are optional.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          #!/bin/bash
          #
          # Perform hot backups of Oracle databases.
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
      </p>

      
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Function Comments">
    <SUMMARY>
      Any function that is not both obvious and short must be commented. Any
      function in a library must be commented regardless of length or
      complexity.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        It should be possible for someone else to learn how to use your
        program or to use a function in your library by reading the comments
        (and self-help, if provided) without reading the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        All function comments should contain:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Description of the function
          </li>
          <li>
            Global variables used and modified
          </li>
          <li>
            Arguments taken
          </li>
          <li>
            Returned values other than the default exit status of the last
            command run
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          #!/bin/bash
          #
          # Perform hot backups of Oracle databases.

          export PATH='/usr/xpg4/bin:/usr/bin:/opt/csw/bin:/opt/goog/bin'

          #######################################
          # Cleanup files from the backup dir
          # Globals:
          #   BACKUP_DIR
          #   ORACLE_SID
          # Arguments:
          #   None
          # Returns:
          #   None
          #######################################
          cleanup() {
            ...
          }
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Implementation Comments">
    <SUMMARY>
      Comment tricky, non-obvious, interesting or important parts of your code.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        This follows general Google coding comment practice. Don't comment
        everything.  If there's a complex algorithm or you're doing something
        out of the ordinary, put a short comment in.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="TODO Comments">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use TODO comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or
      good-enough but not perfect.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        This matches the convention in the <a href="cppguide.xml?showone=TODO_Comments#TODO_Comments">C++
          Guide</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         TODOs should include the string TODO in all caps, followed by your
         username in parentheses. A colon is optional. It's preferable to put a
         bug/ticket number next to the TODO item as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
        
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          # TODO(mrmonkey): Handle the unlikely edge cases (bug ####)
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

</CATEGORY>

<CATEGORY title="Formatting">
  <p>
    While you should follow the style that's already there for files that
    you're modifying, the following are required for any new code.
  </p>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Indentation">
    <SUMMARY>
      Indent 2 spaces. No tabs.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Use blank lines between blocks to improve readability.  Indentation is
        two spaces.  Whatever you do, don't use tabs.  For existing files, stay
        faithful to the existing indentation.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Line Length and Long Strings">
    <SUMMARY>
      Maximum line length is 80 characters.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        If you have to write strings that are longer than 80 characters, this
        should be done with a here document or an embedded newline if possible.
        Literal strings that have to be longer than 80 chars and can't sensibly
        be split are ok, but it's strongly preferred to find a way to make it
        shorter.
      </p>
      <p>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          # DO use 'here document's
          cat &lt;&lt;END;
          I am an exceptionally long
          string.
          END

          # Embedded newlines are ok too
          long_string="I am an exceptionally
            long string."
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Pipelines">
    <SUMMARY>
      Pipelines should be split one per line if they don't all fit on one line.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        If a pipeline all fits on one line, it should be on one line.
      </p>
      <p>
        If not, it should be split at one pipe segment per line with the pipe
        on the newline and a 2 space indent for the next section of the pipe.
        This applies to a chain of commands combined using '|' as well as to
        logical compounds using '||' and '&amp;&amp;'.
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          # All fits on one line
          command1 | command2

          # Long commands
          command1 \
            | command2 \
            | command3 \
            | command4
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Loops">
    <SUMMARY>
      Put <code>; do</code> and <code>; then</code> on the same line as the
      <code>while</code>, <code>for</code> or <code>if</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Loops in shell are a bit different, but we follow the same principles
        as with braces when declaring functions. That is: <code>; then</code>
        and <code>; do</code> should be on the same line as the if/for/while.
        <code>else</code> should be on its own line and closing statements
        should be on their own line vertically aligned with the opening
        statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          for dir in ${dirs_to_cleanup}; do
            if [[ -d "${dir}/${ORACLE_SID}" ]]; then
              log_date "Cleaning up old files in ${dir}/${ORACLE_SID}"
              rm "${dir}/${ORACLE_SID}/"*
              if [[ "$?" -ne 0 ]]; then
                error_message
              fi
            else
              mkdir -p "${dir}/${ORACLE_SID}"
              if [[ "$?" -ne 0 ]]; then
                error_message
              fi
            fi
          done
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Case statement">
    <SUMMARY>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Indent alternatives by 2 spaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          A one-line alternative needs a space after the close parenthesis of
          the pattern and before the <code>;;</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Long or multi-command alternatives should be split over multiple
          lines with the pattern, actions, and <code>;;</code> on separate
          lines.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        The matching expressions are indented one level from the 'case' and
        'esac'.  Multiline actions are indented another level.  In general,
        there is no need to quote match expressions.  Pattern expressions
        should not be preceded by an open parenthesis.  Avoid the
        <code>;&amp;</code> and <code>;;&amp;</code> notations.
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        case "${expression}" in
          a)
            variable="..."
            some_command "${variable}" "${other_expr}" ...
            ;;
          absolute)
            actions="relative"
            another_command "${actions}" "${other_expr}" ...
            ;;

            ;;
        esac
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        Simple commands may be put on the same line as the pattern <i>and</i>
        <code>;;</code> as long as the expression remains readable.  This is
        often appropriate for single-letter option processing.  When the
        actions don't fit on a single line, put the pattern on a line on its
        own, then the actions, then <code>;;</code> also on a line of its own.
        When on the same line as the actions, use a space after the close
        parenthesis of the pattern and another before the <code>;;</code>.

      Use <code>$(command)</code> instead of backticks.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Nested backticks require escaping the inner ones with <code>\</code>.
        The <code>$(command)</code> format doesn't change when nested and is
        easier to read.
      </p>

        <code>[[ ... ]]</code> reduces errors as no pathname expansion or word

        If you're writing single functions, use lowercase and separate words

      <p>
        For unpiped commands, use <code>$?</code> or check directly via an
        <code>if</code> statement to keep it simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:
        <CODE_SNIPPET>

      <p>
        Bash also has the <code>PIPESTATUS</code> variable that allows checking
        of the return code from all parts of a pipe. If it's only necessary to
        check success or failure of the whole pipe, then the following is
        acceptable:
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          tar -cf - ./* | ( cd "${dir}" &amp;&amp; tar -xf - )

      <p>
        However, as <code>PIPESTATUS</code> will be overwritten as soon as you
        do any other command, if you need to act differently on errors based on
        where it happened in the pipe, you'll need to assign
        <code>PIPESTATUS</code> to another variable immediately after running
        the command (don't forget that <code>[</code> is a command and will
