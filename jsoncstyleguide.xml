<STYLEPOINT title="Display Hidden Details in this Guide">
<SUMMARY>
This style guide contains many details that are initially hidden from view.  They are marked by the triangle icon, which you see here on your left.  Click it now.  You should see "Hooray" appear below.
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>Hooray!  Now you know you can expand points to get more details.  Alternatively, there's an "expand all" at the top of this document.</p>

<CATEGORY title="Introduction">
<p>This style guide documents guidelines and recommendations for building JSON APIs at Google.  In general, JSON APIs should follow the spec found at <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON.org</a>.  This style guide clarifies and standardizes specific cases so that JSON APIs from Google have a standard look and feel.  These guidelines are applicable to JSON requests and responses in both RPC-based and REST-based APIs.</p>
</CATEGORY>
<CATEGORY title="Definitions">
<p>For the purposes of this style guide, we define the following terms:</p><ul><li><b>property</b> - a name/value pair inside a JSON object.</li><li><b>property name</b> - the name (or key) portion of the property.</li><li><b>property value</b> - the value portion of the property.</li></ul>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
{
  // The name/value pair together is a "property".
  "propertyName": "propertyValue"
}

</CODE_SNIPPET>
<p>Javascript's <code>number</code> type encompasses all floating-point numbers, which is a broad designation.  In this guide, <code>number</code> will refer to JavaScript's <code>number</code> type, while <code>integer</code> will refer to integers.</p>
</CATEGORY>
</OVERVIEW>
<CATEGORY title="General Guidelines">
<STYLEPOINT title="Comments">
<SUMMARY>
No comments in JSON objects.
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>Comments should not be included in JSON objects.  Some of the examples in this style guide include comments.  However this is only to clarify the examples.</p>
<BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
{
  // You may see comments in the examples below,
  // But don't include comments in your JSON.
  "propertyName": "propertyValue"
}

</BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
</BODY>
</STYLEPOINT>
<STYLEPOINT title="Double Quotes">
<SUMMARY>
Use double quotes.
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>If a property requires quotes, double quotes must be used.  All property names must be surrounded by double quotes.  Property values of type string must be surrounded by double quotes.  Other value types (like boolean or number) should not be surrounded by double quotes.</p>
</BODY>
</STYLEPOINT>
<STYLEPOINT title="Flattened data vs Structured Hierarchy">
<SUMMARY>
Data should not be arbitrarily grouped for convenience.
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>Data elements should be "flattened" in the JSON representation.  Data should not be arbitrarily grouped for convenience.</p><p>In some cases, such as a collection of properties that represents a single structure, it may make sense to keep the structured hierarchy.  These cases should be carefully considered, and only used if it makes semantic sense.  For example, an address could be represented two ways, but the structured way probably makes more sense for developers:</p>
<p>Flattened Address:</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
{
  "company": "Google",
  "website": "http://www.google.com/",
  "addressLine1": "111 8th Ave",
  "addressLine2": "4th Floor",
  "state": "NY",
  "city": "New York",
  "zip": "10011"
}
</CODE_SNIPPET>
<p>Structured Address:</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
{
  "company": "Google",
  "website": "http://www.google.com/",
  "address": {
    "line1": "111 8th Ave",
    "line2": "4th Floor",
    "state": "NY",
    "city": "New York",
    "zip": "10011"
  }
}
</CODE_SNIPPET>
</BODY>
</STYLEPOINT>
</CATEGORY>
<CATEGORY title="Property Name Guidelines">
<STYLEPOINT title="Property Name Format">
<SUMMARY>
Choose meaningful property names.
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>Property names must conform to the following guidelines:</p><ul><li>Property names should be meaningful names with defined semantics.</li><li>Property names must be camel-cased, ascii strings.</li><li>The first character must be a letter, an underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($).</li><li>Subsequent characters can be a letter, a digit, an underscore, or a dollar sign.</li><li>Reserved JavaScript keywords should be avoided (A list of reserved JavaScript keywords can be found below).</li></ul><p>These guidelines mirror the guidelines for naming JavaScript identifiers.  This allows JavaScript clients to access properties using dot notation.  (for example, <code>result.thisIsAnInstanceVariable</code>).  Here's an example of an object with one property:</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
{
  "thisPropertyIsAnIdentifier": "identifier value"
}

</CODE_SNIPPET>
</BODY>
</STYLEPOINT>
<STYLEPOINT title="Key Names in JSON Maps">
<SUMMARY>
JSON maps can use any Unicode character in key names.
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>The property name naming rules do not apply when a JSON object is used as a map.  A map (also referred to as an associative array) is a data type with arbitrary key/value pairs that use the keys to access the corresponding values.  JSON objects and JSON maps look the same at runtime; this distinction is relevant to the design of the API.  The API documentation should indicate when JSON objects are used as maps.</p><p>The keys of a map do not have to obey the naming guidelines for property names.  Map keys may contain any Unicode characters.  Clients can access these properties using the square bracket notation familiar for maps (for example, <code>result.thumbnails["72"]</code>).</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
{
  // The "address" property is a sub-object
  // holding the parts of an address.
  "address": {
    "addressLine1": "123 Anystreet",
    "city": "Anytown",
    "state": "XX",
    "zip": "00000"
  },
  // The "thumbnails" property is a map that maps
  // a pixel size to the thumbnail url of that size.
  "thumbnails": {
    "72": "http://url.to.72px.thumbnail",
    "144": "http://url.to.144px.thumbnail"
  }
}

</CODE_SNIPPET>
</BODY>
</STYLEPOINT>
<STYLEPOINT title="Reserved Property Names">
<SUMMARY>
Certain property names are reserved for consistent use across services.
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>Details about reserved property names, along with the full list, can be found later on in this guide.  Services should avoid using these property names for anything other than their defined semantics.</p>
</BODY>
</STYLEPOINT>
<STYLEPOINT title="Singular vs Plural Property Names">
<SUMMARY>
Array types should have plural property names.  All other property names should be singular.
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>Arrays usually contain multiple items, and a plural property name reflects this.  An example of this can be seen in the reserved names below.  The <code>items</code> property name is plural because it represents an array of item objects.  Most of the other fields are singular.</p><p>There may be exceptions to this, especially when referring to numeric property values.  For example, in the reserved names, <code>totalItems</code> makes more sense than <code>totalItem</code>.  However, technically, this is not violating the style guide, since <code>totalItems</code> can be viewed as <code>totalOfItems</code>, where <code>total</code> is singular (as per the style guide), and <code>OfItems</code> serves to qualify the total.  The field name could also be changed to <code>itemCount</code> to look singular.</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
{
  // Singular
  "author": "lisa",
  // An array of siblings, plural
  "siblings": [ "bart", "maggie"],
  // "totalItem" doesn't sound right
  "totalItems": 10,
  // But maybe "itemCount" is better
  "itemCount": 10,
}

</CODE_SNIPPET>
</BODY>
</STYLEPOINT>
<STYLEPOINT title="Naming Conflicts">
<SUMMARY>
Avoid naming conflicts by choosing a new property name or versioning the API.
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>New properties may be added to the reserved list in the future.  There is no concept of JSON namespacing.  If there is a naming conflict, these can usually be resolved by choosing a new property name or by versioning.  For example, suppose we start with the following JSON object:</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
{
  "apiVersion": "1.0",
  "data": {
    "recipeName": "pizza",
    "ingredients": ["tomatoes", "cheese", "sausage"]
  }
}

</CODE_SNIPPET>
<p>If in the future we wish to make <code>ingredients</code> a reserved word, we can do one of two things:</p><p>1) Choose a different name:</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
{
  "apiVersion": "1.0",
  "data": {
    "recipeName": "pizza",
    "ingredientsData": "Some new property",
    "ingredients": ["tomatoes", "cheese", "sausage"]
  }
}

</CODE_SNIPPET>
<p>2) Rename the property on a major version boundary:</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
{
  "apiVersion": "2.0",
  "data": {
    "recipeName": "pizza",
    "ingredients": "Some new property",
    "recipeIngredients": ["tomatos", "cheese", "sausage"]
  }
}

</CODE_SNIPPET>
</BODY>
</STYLEPOINT>
</CATEGORY>
<CATEGORY title="Property Value Guidelines">
<STYLEPOINT title="Property Value Format">
<SUMMARY>
Property values must be Unicode booleans, numbers, strings, objects, arrays, or <code>null</code>.
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>The spec at <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON.org</a> specifies exactly what type of data is allowed in a property value. This includes Unicode booleans, numbers, strings, objects, arrays, and <code>null</code>. JavaScript expressions are not allowed. APIs should support that spec for all values, and should choose the data type most appropriate for a particular property (numbers to represent numbers, etc.).</p><p>Good:</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
{
  "canPigsFly": null,     // null
  "areWeThereYet": false, // boolean
  "answerToLife": 42,     // number
  "name": "Bart",         // string
  "moreData": {},         // object
  "things": []            // array
}

</CODE_SNIPPET>
<p>Bad:</p>
<BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
{
  "aVariableName": aVariableName,         // Bad - JavaScript identifier
  "functionFoo": function() { return 1; } // Bad - JavaScript function
}

</BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
</BODY>
</STYLEPOINT>
<STYLEPOINT title="Empty/Null Property Values">
<SUMMARY>
Consider removing empty or <code>null</code> values.
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>If a property is optional or has an empty or <code>null</code> value, consider dropping the property from the JSON, unless there's a strong semantic reason for its existence.</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
{
  "volume": 10,

  // Even though the "balance" property's value is zero, it should be left in,
  // since "0" signifies "even balance" (the value could be "-1" for left
  // balance and "+1" for right balance.
  "balance": 0,

  // The "currentlyPlaying" property can be left out since it is null.
  // "currentlyPlaying": null
}

</CODE_SNIPPET>
</BODY>
</STYLEPOINT>
<STYLEPOINT title="Enum Values">
<SUMMARY>
Enum values should be represented as strings.
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>As APIs grow, enum values may be added, removed or changed. Using strings as enum values ensures that downstream clients can gracefully handle changes to enum values.</p><p>Java code:</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
public enum Color {
  WHITE,
  BLACK,
  RED,
  YELLOW,
  BLUE
}

<CATEGORY title="Property Value Data Types">
<p>As mentioned above, property value types must be booleans, numbers, strings, objects, arrays, or <code>null</code>.  However, it is useful define a set of standard data types when dealing with certain values.  These data types will always be strings, but they will be formatted in a specific manner so that they can be easily parsed.</p>
<STYLEPOINT title="Date Property Values">
<SUMMARY>
Dates should be formatted as recommended by RFC 3339.

</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>Latitude/Longitude should be strings formatted as recommended by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_6709">ISO 6709</a>.  Furthermore, they should favor the ±DD.DDDD±DDD.DDDD degrees format.</p>

<CATEGORY title="JSON Structure &amp; Reserved Property Names">
<p>In order to maintain a consistent interface across APIs, JSON objects should follow the structure outlined below.  This structure applies to both requests and responses made with JSON.  Within this structure, there are certain property names that are reserved for specific uses.  These properties are NOT required; in other words, each reserved property may appear zero or one times.  But if a service needs these properties, this naming convention is recommend.  Here is a schema of the JSON structure, represented in <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Forderly-json.org%2F">Orderly</a> format (which in turn can be compiled into a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=D&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fjson-schema.org%2F">JSONSchema</a>).  You can few examples of the JSON structure at the end of this guide.</p>

<CATEGORY title="Top-Level Reserved Property Names">
<p>The top-level of the JSON object may contain the following properties.</p>
<STYLEPOINT title="apiVersion">
<SUMMARY>
Property Value Type: string<br />Parent: -
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>Represents the desired version of the service API in a request, and the version of the service API that's served in the response.  <code>apiVersion</code> should always be present.  This is not related to the version of the data.  Versioning of data should be handled through some other mechanism such as etags.</p><p>Example:</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
{ "apiVersion": "2.1" }

</CODE_SNIPPET>
</BODY>
</STYLEPOINT>
<STYLEPOINT title="context">
<SUMMARY>
Property Value Type: string<br />Parent: -
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>Client sets this value and server echos data in the response.   This is useful in JSON-P and batch situations , where the user can use the <code>context</code> to correlate responses with requests.  This property is a top-level property because the <code>context</code> should present regardless of whether the response was successful or an error.  <code>context</code> differs from <code>id</code> in that <code>context</code> is specified by the user while <code>id</code> is assigned by the service.</p><p>Example:</p><p>Request #1:</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
http://www.google.com/myapi?context=bart

</CODE_SNIPPET>
<p>Request #2:</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>

If <code>items</code> exists, it should be the last property in the <code>data</code> object (See the "Property Ordering" section below for more details).</p><p>Example:</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
{
  "data": {
    "items": [
      { /* Object #1 */ },
      { /* Object #2 */ },
      ...
    ]
  }

<CATEGORY title="Reserved Property Names for Paging">
<p>The following properties are located in the <code>data</code> object, and help page through a list of items.  Some of the language and concepts are borrowed from the <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/Home">OpenSearch specification</a>.</p><p>The paging properties below allow for various styles of paging, including:</p><ul><li>Previous/Next paging - Allows user's to move forward and backward through a list, one page at a time.  The <code>nextLink</code> and <code>previousLink</code> properties (described in the "Reserved Property Names for Links" section below) are used for this style of paging.</li><li>Index-based paging - Allows user's to jump directly to a specific item position within a list of items.  For example, to load 10 items starting at item 200, the developer may point the user to a url with the query string <code>?startIndex=200</code>.</li><li>Page-based paging - Allows user's to jump directly to a specific page within the items.  This is similar to index-based paging, but saves the developer the extra step of having to calculate the item index for a new page of items.  For example, rather than jump to item number 200, the developer could jump to page 20.  The urls during page-based paging could use the query string <code>?page=1</code> or <code>?page=20</code>.  The <code>pageIndex</code> and <code>totalPages</code> properties are used for this style of paging.</li></ul><p>An example of how to use these properties to implement paging can be found at the end of this guide.</p>
<STYLEPOINT title="data.currentItemCount">
<SUMMARY>
Property Value Type: integer<br />Parent: <code>data</code>
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>The number of items in this result set.  Should be equivalent to items.length, and is provided as a convenience property.  For example, suppose a developer requests a set of search items, and asks for 10 items per page.  The total set of that search has 14 total items.  The first page of items will have 10 items in it, so both <code>itemsPerPage</code> and <code>currentItemCount</code> will equal "10".  The next page of items will have the remaining 4 items; <code>itemsPerPage</code> will still be "10", but <code>currentItemCount</code> will be "4".</p><p>Example:</p>
<CODE_SNIPPET>
{
  "data": {
    // "itemsPerPage" does not necessarily match "currentItemCount"
    "itemsPerPage": 10,
    "currentItemCount": 4

<CATEGORY title="Property Ordering">
<p>Properties can be in any order within the JSON object.  However, in some cases the ordering of properties can help parsers quickly interpret data and lead to better performance.  One example is a pull parser in a mobile environment, where performance and memory are critical, and unnecessary parsing should be avoided.</p>
<STYLEPOINT title="Kind Property">
<SUMMARY>
<code>kind</code> should be the first property
</SUMMARY>
<BODY>
<p>Suppose a parser is responsible for parsing a raw JSON stream into a specific object.  The <code>kind</code> property guides the parser to instantiate the appropriate object.  Therefore it should be the first property in the JSON object.  This only applies when objects have a <code>kind</code> property (usually found in the <code>data</code> and <code>items</code> properties).</p>
</BODY>
</STYLEPOINT>
<STYLEPOINT title="Items Property">
<SUMMARY>
<code>items</code> should be the last property in the <code>data</code> object
