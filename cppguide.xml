<!-- The BODY onLoad redirect is the best: it preserves #fragments and
     ?queries.  But it requires javascript.  If that fails, the
     meta-refresh kicks in; it works more generally, but loses fragments
     and queries, takes a second, and pollutes the browser history.
     If they both fail, we let the user manually click on the new link.
