# Google Style Guides

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This project
([google/styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide)) links to the
style guidelines we use for Google code. If you are modifying a project that
originated at Google, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides
that apply to that project.

This project holds the [C++ Style Guide][cpp], [C# Style Guide][csharp],
[Swift Style Guide][swift], [Objective-C Style Guide][objc],
[Java Style Guide][java], [Python Style Guide][py], [R Style Guide][r],
[Shell Style Guide][sh], [HTML/CSS Style Guide][htmlcss],
[JavaScript Style Guide][js], [TypeScript Style Guide][ts], [AngularJS Style Guide][angular],
[Common Lisp Style Guide][cl], and [Vimscript Style Guide][vim]. This project
also contains [cpplint][cpplint], a tool to assist with style guide compliance,
and [google-c-style.el][emacs], an Emacs settings file for Google style.

If your project requires that you create a new XML document format, the [XML
Document Format Style Guide][xml] may be helpful. In addition to actual style
rules, it also contains advice on designing your own vs. adapting an existing
format, on XML instance document formatting, and on elements vs. attributes.

The style guides in this project are licensed under the CC-By 3.0 License,

The following Google style guides live outside of this project:
- [Go Code Review Comments][go]
- [Effective Dart][dart]
- [Kotlin Style Guide][kotlin]


## Contributing

With few exceptions, these style guides are copies of Google's internal style guides
to assist developers working on Google owned and originated open source projects.
Changes to the style guides are made to the internal style guides first and
eventually copied into the versions found here. **External contributions are
not accepted.** 
Pull requests are regularly closed without comment.
Issues that raise questions, justify changes on technical merits,
or point out obvious mistakes may get some engagement and could in theory lead to changes,
but we are primarily optimizing for Google's internal needs.
