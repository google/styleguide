  <p>
    Common Lisp is a powerful multiparadigm programming language.
    With great power comes great responsibility.
    This guide recommends formatting and stylistic choices
    designed to make your code easier for other people to understand.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Must, Should, May, or Not">
    <SUMMARY>
      Each guideline's level of importance is indicated
      by use of the following keywords and phrases, adapted from
      <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th valign="top">MUST</th>
          <td>
            <p>
              This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL",
              means that the guideline is an absolute requirement.
              You must ask permission to violate a MUST.

          <th valign="top">MUST NOT</th>
          <td>
            <p>
              This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT",
              means that the guideline is an absolute prohibition.
              You must ask permission to violate a MUST NOT.

          <td>
            <p>
              This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", means that
              there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances
              to ignore the demands of the guideline, but
              the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed
              before choosing a different course.
              You must ask forgiveness for violating a SHOULD.

              This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED", means that
              there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances
              to ignore the prohibitions of this guideline, but
              the full implications should be understood and carefully weighed

        Unlike RFCs, we don't capitalize every instance of one of the above
        keywords when it is used.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>
  <STYLEPOINT title="Permission and Forgiveness">
    <SUMMARY>
      There are cases where transgression of some of these rules
      is useful or even necessary.
      In some cases, you must seek permission or obtain forgiveness
      from the proper people.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Permission comes from the OWNERS of your project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forgiveness is requested in a comment
        near the point of guideline violation,
        and is granted by your code reviewer.
        The original comment should be signed by you, and
        the reviewer should add a signed approval to the comment at review time.
      </p>
      
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>
  <STYLEPOINT title="Conventions">
    <SUMMARY>
      Some guidelines, such those about as comments and indentation,
      are based purely on convention, rather than on clear technical merit.
      However, conventions are important for readability,
      thus most conventions are MUSTs.
    </SUMMARY>
  </STYLEPOINT>
  <STYLEPOINT title="Old Code">
    <p>
      A lot of our code was written before these guidelines existed.
      You should fix violations as you encounter them
      in the course of your normal coding.
      You must not fix violations en masse
      without warning other developers and coordinating with them,
      so as not to make the merging of large branches
      more difficult than it already is.
    </p>
  </STYLEPOINT>
  <STYLEPOINT title="Future Topics">
    <SUMMARY>
      There are many topics for additional standardization
      not covered by current version of this document,
      but deferred to future versions.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <ul>

<CATEGORY title="General Guidelines">
  <STYLEPOINT title="Principles">
    <SUMMARY>
      There are some basic principles for team software development
      that every developer must keep in mind.
      Whenever the detailed guidelines are inadequate, confusing or contradictory,
      refer back to these principles for guidance:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every developer's code must be easy for another developer
          to read, understand, and modify
          &#8212; even if the first developer isn't around to explain it.
          (This is the "hit by a truck" principle.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Everybody's code should look the same.
          Ideally, there should be no way to look at lines of code
          and recognize it as "Fred's code" by its style.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't be "clever" &#8212;
          do the simplest thing that could possibly work properly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be precise.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be concise.
        </li>
        <li>
          KISS &#8212; Keep It Simple, Stupid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the smallest hammer for the job.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use common sense.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep related code together.
          Minimize the amount of jumping around
          someone has to do to understand an area of code.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>
  <STYLEPOINT title="Priorities">
    <SUMMARY>
      <p>
        When making decisions about how to write a given piece of
        code, aim for the following -ilities in this priority order:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Usability by the customer
        </li>
        <li>
          Debuggability/Testability
        </li>
        <li>
          Readability/Comprehensibility
        </li>
        <li>
          Extensibility/Modifiability
        </li>
        <li>
          Efficiency (of the Lisp code at runtime)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Most of these are obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usability by the customer means that the system has to do what the
        customer requires; it has to handle the customer's transaction
        volumes, uptime requirements; etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the Lisp efficiency point,
        given two options of equivalent complexity,
        pick the one that performs better.
        (This is often the same as the one that conses less,
        i.e. allocates less storage from the heap.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Given two options where one is more complex than the other,
        pick the simpler option and revisit the decision only if
        profiling shows it to be a performance bottleneck.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, avoid premature optimization.
        Don't add complexity to speed up something that runs rarely,
        since in the long run, it matters less whether such code is fast.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>
  <STYLEPOINT title="Architecture">
    <SUMMARY>
      To build code that is robust and maintainable,
      it matters a lot how the code is divided into components,
      how these components communicate,
      how changes propagate as they evolve,
      and more importantly
      how the programmers who develop these components communicate
      as these components evolve.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        If your work affects other groups, might be reusable across groups,
        adds new components, has an impact on other groups
        (including QA or Ops), or otherwise isn't purely local,
        you must write it up using at least a couple of paragraphs,
        and get a design approval from the other parties involved
        before starting to write code &#8212; or be ready to scratch what you have
        when they object.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't know or don't care about these issues,
        ask someone who does.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>
  <STYLEPOINT title="Using Libraries">
    <SUMMARY>
      Often, the smallest hammer is to use an existing library.
      Or one that doesn't exist yet.
      In such cases, you are encouraged to use or develop such a library,
      but you must take appropriate precautions.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You MUST NOT start a new library
          unless you established that none is already available
          that can be fixed or completed into becoming what you need.
          That's a rule against the NIH syndrome ("Not Invented Here"),
          which is particularly strong amongst Lisp hackers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whichever library, old or new, you pick, you MUST get permission
          to incorporate third-party code into the code base.
          You must discuss the use of such library
          in the appropriate mailing-list,
          and have your code reviewed by people knowledgeable in the domain
          and/or the Lisp library ecosystem (if any).
          Please be ready to argue why this particular solution makes sense
          as compared to other available libraries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some libraries are distributed under licenses not compatible
          with the software you're writing, and
          must not be considered available for use.
          Be aware of these issues, or consult with people who are.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Note that if you have a "clever" implementation trick,
        and your trick really is clever,
        then you must definitely not include it in business specific code;
        but it may have its place in an open-source library used by the code.
        If your idea is not general purpose enough to have any users
        beyond your regular business users,
        then it is definitely either not clever enough or way too clever,
        and in either case does not belong in the code.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>
  <STYLEPOINT title="Open-Sourcing Code">
    <SUMMARY>
      <p>
        If you write a general-purpose library,
        or modify an existing open-source library,
        you are encouraged to publish the result
        separate from your main project and then
        have your project import it like any other open-source library.
      </p>
      
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Use your judgement to distinguish
        general-purpose versus business-specific code,
        and open-source the general-purpose parts,
        while keeping the business-specific parts a trade secret.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Open-Sourcing code has many advantages,
        including being able to leverage third parties for development,
        letting the development of features be user-directed,
        and keeping you honest with respect to code quality.
        Whatever code you write, you will have to maintain anyway,
        and make sure its quality is high enough to sustain use in production.
        There should therefore be no additional burden to Open-Sourcing,
        even of code that (at least initially)
        is not directly usable by third parties.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Development Process">
    <SUMMARY>
      Development process is outside the scope of this document.
      However, developers should remember at least these bits:
      get reviewed, write tests, eliminate warnings, run tests, avoid mass-changes.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All code changes must be reviewed.
          You should expect that your code will be reviewed by other hackers,
          and that you will be assigned other hackers' code to review.
          Part of the review criteria will be that code obeys
          the coding standards in this document.
        </li>
        <li>
          You must write and check-in tests for new code that you write and old bugs you fix.
          There must be a unit test for every API function,
          and any previously failing case.
          Your work is not truly done until this activity is complete.
          Estimating tasks must include the time it takes to produce such tests.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your code must compile
          without any compilation error or warning messages whatsoever.
          If the compiler issues warnings that should be ignored,
          muffle those warnings using the
          <code>xcvb-driver:with-controlled-compiler-conditions</code> and
          <code>xcvb-driver:*uninteresting-conditions*</code>
          framework (also available as <code>asdf-condition-control</code>),
          either around the entire project, or around individual files
          (using asdf's <code>:around-compile</code> hooks).
        </li>
        <li>
          You must run the "precheckin" tests successfully
          before committing code.
        </li>
        <li>
          We should/will/must incorporate code coverage
          into our testing process.
          Tests are not sufficient
          if they do not cover all new and updated code;
          code that for whatever reason cannot be included in coverage results
          should be clearly marked as such including the reason.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many people develop on branches.
          You must get permission to undertake mass-changes
          (e.g. mass reindentations)
          so that we can coordinate in advance,
          and give branch residents time to get back on the mainline

  <STYLEPOINT title="Spelling">
    <SUMMARY>
      <p>
        You must use correct spelling in your comments,
        and most importantly in your identifiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        When several correct spellings exist (including American vs English),
        and there isn't a consensus amongst developers as which to use,
        you should choose the shorter spelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must avoid using abbreviations for words,
        unless it's a word that is used very frequently,
        in which case you must use
        the <em>same</em> abbreviation <em>consistently</em>.

        Some line length restriction is better than none at all.
        Google Java developers have adopted

        and C++ developers limit themselves to 80 columns.
        Common Lispers at ITA have long adopted the 100-column limit.

        Use indentation to make complex function applications easier to read.
        When an application does not fit on one line
        or the function takes many arguments,
        consider inserting newlines between the arguments
        so that each one is on a separate line.
        However, do not insert newlines in a way that makes it hard to tell
        how many arguments the function takes
        or where an argument form starts and ends.

        Blank lines can be used to separate parts of a complicated function.
        Generally, however, you should break a large function into smaller ones

    <SUMMARY>
      You should use document strings to explain how code works.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        You must comment anything complicated
        so that the next developer can understand what's going on.
        (Again, the "hit by a truck" principle.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless some bit of code is painfully self-explanatory, document it.
        Prefer documentation strings to comments
        because the former can be displayed by programming tools, such as IDEs,
        or by REPL queries such as <code>(describe 'foo)</code>;
        they can also be extracted
        to create web-based documentation or other reference works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Supply a documentation string (also known as docstring) when defining
        top-level functions, types, classes, and macros.
        Generally, add a documentation string wherever the language allows.
      </p>
      <p>
        For functions, the docstring should describe the function's contract:
        what the function does,
        what the arguments mean,
        what values are returned,
        what conditions the function can signal.
        It should be expressed at the appropriate level of abstraction,
        explaining the intended meaning rather than, say, just the syntax.
        In documentation strings, capitalize the names of Lisp symbols,
        such as function arguments.
        For example, "The value of LENGTH should be an integer."

        A long docstring may usefully
        begin with a short, single-sentence summary,
        followed by the larger body of the docstring.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the name of a type is used,
        the symbol may be quoted by surrounding it with
        a back quote at the beginning and a single quote at the end.
        Emacs will highlight the type, and the highlighting serves
        as a cue to the reader that <kbd>M-.</kbd>
        will lead to the symbol's definition.

        Every method of a generic function should be independently documented

        A TODO comment is not a commitment to fix the problem.

    <BODY>
      <p>
        Use lower case for all symbols.
        Consistently using lower case makes searching for symbol names easier
        and is more readable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that Common Lisp is case-converting,
        and that the <code>symbol-name</code> of your symbols
        will be upper case.
        Because of this case-converting,
        attempts to distinguish symbols by case are defeated,
        and only result in confusion.
        While it is possible to escape characters in symbols
        to force lower case,
        you should not use this capability
        unless this is somehow necessary
        to interoperate with third-party software.

      <p>
        Place hyphens between all the words in a symbol.

        the <em>same</em> abbreviation <em>consistently</em>.
        Abbreviations may also be used sparingly to avoid overly-long symbol names;
        it's easy to run into 100-column limit when there are very long names!
        You must especially avoid inconsistent abbreviations in exported names.
        For lexical variables of limited scope, abbreviations are fine.

      Name your variables according to their intent,

    <BODY>
      <p>
        You should name a variable according
        to the high-level concept that it represents,
        not according to the low-level implementation details
        of how the concept is represented.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, you should avoid embedding
        data structure or aggregate type names,
        such as <code>list</code>, <code>array</code>, or
        <code>hash-table</code> inside variable names,
        unless you're writing a generic algorithm that applies to
        arbitrary lists, arrays, hash-tables, etc.
        In that case it's perfectly OK to name a variable
        <code>list</code> or <code>array</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, you should be introducing new abstract data types
        with <code>DEFCLASS</code> or <code>DEFTYPE</code>,
        whenever a new kind of intent appears for objects in your protocols.
        Functions that manipulate such objects generically may then
        use variables the name of which reflect that abstract type.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if a variable's value is always a row
        (or is either a row or <code>NIL</code>),
        it's good to call it <code>row</code> or <code>first-row</code>
        or something like that.
        It is alright is <code>row</code> has been
        <code>DEFTYPE</code>'d to <code>STRING</code> &#8212;
        precisely because you have abstracted the detail away,
        and the remaining salient point is that it is a row.
        You should not name the variable <code>STRING</code> in this context,
        except possibly in low-level functions that specifically manipulate
        the innards of rows to provide the suitable abstraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be consistent.
        If a variable is named <code>row</code> in one function,
        and its value is being passed to a second function,
        then call it <code>row</code> rather than, say, <code>value</code>
        (this was a real case).

    <BODY>
      <p>
        Common Lisp systems are not required to implement constant space
        optimizations for recursive function calls from tail positions;
        however, most serious implementations (including SBCL and CCL)
        do implement proper tail calls.
        Still, even compilers that implement proper tail call do it
        only in restricted conditions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <code>(DECLARE (OPTIMIZE ...))</code> settings
          must favor <code>SPEED</code> enough and
          not favor <code>DEBUG</code> too much,
          for some compiler-dependent meanings of "enough" and "too much".
          (For instance, in SBCL, you should avoid <code>(SPEED 0)</code>
          and <code>(DEBUG 3)</code> to achieve tail call elimination.)
        </li>
        <li>
          There should not be dynamic bindings around the call
          (even though some Scheme compilers are able to properly treat
          such dynamic bindings, called parameters in Scheme parlance).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For compatibility with all compilers and
        to avoid stack overflow when debugging,
        you should use iteration or the built in mapping functions
        rather than relying on proper tail calls.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do rely on proper tail calls,
        you must prominently document the fact,
        and take appropriate measures to ensure an appropriate compiler is used
        with appropriate optimization settings.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Special variables">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use special variables sparingly.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Using Lisp "special" (dynamically bound) variables
        as implicit arguments to functions should be used sparingly,
        and only in cases where it won't surprise the person reading the code,
        and where it offers significant benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good candidates for such special variables
        are items for which "the current" can be naturally used as prefix,
        such as "the current database connection" or
        "the current business data source".
        They are singletons as far as the rest of the code is concerned,
        and often passing them as an explicit argument
        does not add anything to the readability or maintainability
        of the source code in question.
      </p>
      <p>
        They can make it easier to write code that can be refactored.
        If you have a request processing chain,
        with a number of layers that all operate upon a "current" request,
        passing the request object explicitly to every function
        requires that every function in the chain have a request argument.
        Factoring out code into new functions often requires
        that these functions also have this argument,
        which clutters the code with boilerplate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that a Lisp special variable is not a global variable
        in the sense of a global variable in, say, BASIC or C.
        As special variables can be dynamically bound,
        they are much more powerful than
        global value cells that can be changed from everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should treat special variables
        as though they are per-thread variables.
        That is, leave the special variable with no top-level binding at all,
        and each thread of control
        that needs the variable should bind it explicitly.
        This will mean that any incorrect use of the variable
        will result in an "unbound variable" error, and
        each thread will see its own value for the variable.

        Regarding multiple assignment in a same form, there are two schools:
        the first style groups as many assignments as possible into a single

        thus minimizing the number of forms with side-effects;
        the second style splits assignments into as many individual
        <code>SETF</code> (or <code>SETQ</code>, see below) forms as possible,
        to maximize the chances of locating forms that modify a kind of place
        by grepping for <code>(setf (foo ...</code>.
        A grep pattern must actually contain as many place-modifying forms
        as you may use in your programs, which may make this rationale either
        convincing or moot depending on the rest of the style of your code.
        You should follow the convention used in the package you are hacking.
        We recommend the first convention for new packages.

        Regarding <code>SETF</code> and <code>SETQ</code>,

        this first regards <code>SETQ</code>
        as an archaic implementation detail,
        and avoids it entirely in favor of <code>SETF</code>;
        the second regards <code>SETF</code>
        as an additional layer of complexity,
        and avoids it in favor of <code>SETQ</code> whenever possible
        (i.e. whenever the assigned place is a variable or symbol-macro).
        You should follow the convention used in the package you are hacking.
        We recommend the first convention for new packages.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Packages">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use packages appropriately.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Lisp packages are used to demarcate namespaces.
        Usually, each system has its own namespace.
        A package has a set of external symbols,
        which are intended to be used from outside the package,
        in order to allow other modules to use this module's facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The internal symbols of a package
        should never be referred to from other packages.
        That is, you should never have to use
        the double-colon <code>::</code> construct.
        (e.g. <code>QUAKE::HIDDEN-FUNCTION</code>).
        If you need to use double-colons to write real production code,
        something is wrong and needs to be fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an exception,
        unit tests may use the internals of the package being tested.
        So when you refactor, look at the package's unit tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>::</code> construct is also useful for very temporary hacks,
        and at the REPL.
        But if the symbol really is part of
        the externally-visible definition of the package,
        export it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each package is one of two types:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Intended to be included
          in the <code>:use</code> specification of other packages.
          If package <code>A</code> "uses" package <code>B</code>,
          then the external symbols of package <code>B</code>
          can be referenced from within package <code>A</code>
          without a package prefix.
          We mainly use this for low-level modules
          that provide widely-used facilities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not intended to be "used".
          To reference a facility provided by package <code>B</code>,
          code in package <code>A</code> must use an explicit package prefix,
          e.g. <code>B:DO-THIS</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you add a new package, it should always be of the second type,
        unless you have a special reason and get permission.
        Usually a package is designed to be one or the other,
        by virtue of the names of the functions.
        For example, if you have an abstraction called <code>FIFO</code>,
        and it were in a package of the first type
        you'd have functions named things like
        <code>FIFO-ADD-TO</code> and <code>FIFO-CLEAR-ALL</code>.
        If you used a package of the second type,
        you'd have names like <code>ADD-TO</code> and <code>CLEAR-ALL</code>,
        because the callers would be saying
        <code>FIFO:ADD-TO</code> and <code>FIFO:CLEAR-ALL</code>.
        (<code>FIFO:FIFO-CLEAR-ALL</code> is redundant and ugly.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Another good thing about packages is that
        your symbol names won't "collide" with the names of other packages,
        except the ones your packages "uses".
        So you have to stay away from symbols
        that are part of the Lisp implementation (since you always "use" that)
        and that are part of any other packages you "use",
        but otherwise you are free to make up your own names,
        even short ones, and not worry about some else
        having used the same name.
        You're isolated from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your package must not shadow (and thus effectively redefine)
        symbols that are part of the Common Lisp language.
        There are certain exceptions,
        but they should be very well-justified and extremely rare:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you are explicitly replacing a Common Lisp symbol
          by a safer or more featureful version.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are defining a package not meant to be "used",
          and have a good reason to export a symbol
          that clashes with Common Lisp,
          such as <code>log:error</code> and <code>log:warn</code>
          and so on.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Assertions and Conditions">
    <SUMMARY>
      You must make proper usage of assertions and conditions.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>ASSERT</code> should be used ONLY to detect internal bugs.
          Code should <code>ASSERT</code> invariants whose failure indicates
          that the software is itself broken.
          Incorrect input should be handled properly at runtime,
          and must not cause an assertion violation.
          The audience for an <code>ASSERT</code> failure is a developer.
          Do not use the data-form and argument-form in <code>ASSERT</code>
          to specify a condition to signal.
          It's fine to use them to print out a message for debugging purposes
          (and since it's only for debugging, there's no issue of
          internationalization).
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>CHECK-TYPE</code>,
          <code>ETYPECASE</code> are also forms of assertion.
          When one of these fails, that's a detected bug.
          You should prefer to use <code>CHECK-TYPE</code>
          over (DECLARE (TYPE ...))
          for the inputs of functions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your code should use assertions and type checks liberally.
          The sooner a bug is discovered, the better!
          Only code in the critical path for performance
          and internal helpers should eschew
          explicit assertions and type checks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Invalid input, such as files that are read
          but do not conform to the expected format,
          should not be treated as assertion violations.
          Always check to make sure that input is valid,
          and take appropriate action if it is not,
          such as signalling a real error.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>ERROR</code> should be used
          to detect problems with user data, requests, permissions, etc.,
          or to report "unusual outcomes" to the caller.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>ERROR</code> should always be called
          with an explicit condition type;
          it should never simply be called with a string.
          This enables internationalization.
        </li>
        <li>
          Functions that report unusual outcomes
          by signaling a condition should say so explicitly in their contracts
          (their textual descriptions, in documentation and docstrings etc.).
          When a function signals a condition
          that is not specified by its contract, that's a bug.
          The contract should specify the condition class(es) clearly.
          The function may then signal any condition
          that is a type-of any of those conditions.
          That is, signaling instances of subclasses
          of the documented condition classes is fine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Complex bug-checks may need to use <code>ERROR</code>
          instead of <code>ASSERT</code>.
          
        </li>
        <li>
          When writing a server, you must not call <code>WARN</code>.
          Instead, you should use the appropriate logging framework.
          
        </li>
        <li>
          Code must not call <code>SIGNAL</code>.
          Instead, use <code>ERROR</code> or <code>ASSERT</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Code should not use <code>THROW</code> and <code>CATCH</code>;
          instead use the <code>restart</code> facility.
        </li>
        <li>
          Code should not generically handle all conditions,
          e.g. type <code>T</code>, or use <code>IGNORE-ERRORS</code>.
          Instead, let unknown conditions propagate to
          the standard ultimate handler for processing.
          
        </li>
        <li>
          There are a few places where handling all conditions is appropriate,
          but they are rare.
          The problem is that handling all conditions can mask program bugs.
          If you <em>do</em> need to handle "all conditions",
          you MUST handle only <code>ERROR</code>, <em>not</em> <code>T</code>
          and not <code>SERIOUS-CONDITION</code>.
          (This is notably because CCL's process shutdown
          depends on being able to signal <code>process-reset</code>
          and have it handled by CCL's handler,
          so we must not interpose our own handler.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>(error (make-condition 'foo-error ...))</code>
          is equivalent to <code>(error 'foo-error ...)</code> &#8212;
          code must use the shorter form.
        </li>
        <li>
          Code should not signal conditions from inside the cleanup form of
          <code>UNWIND-PROTECT</code>
          (unless they are always handled inside the cleanup form),
          or otherwise do non-local exits from cleanup handers
          outside of the handler e.g. <code>INVOKE-RESTART</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not clean up by resignaling.
          If you do that, and the condition is not handled,
          the stack trace will halt at the point of the resignal,
          hiding the rest.
          And the rest is the part we really care about!

      <p>
        If your function is using a special variable as an implicit argument,
        it's good to put in a <code>CHECK-TYPE</code> for the special variable,
        for two reasons:
        to clue in the person reading the code
        that this variable is being used implicitly as an argument,
        and also to help detect bugs.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Using <code>(declare (type ...))</code>
        is the least-desirable mechanism to use
        because, as Scott McKay puts it:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The fact is, <code>(declare (type ...))</code> does different things
          depending on the compiler settings of speed, safety, etc.
          In some compilers, when speed is greater than safety,
          <code>(declare (type ...))</code> will tell the compiler
          "please assume that these variables have these types"
          <em>without</em> generating any type-checks.
          That is, if some variable has the value <code>1432</code> in it,
          and you declare it to be of type <code>string</code>,
          the compiler might just go ahead and use it as though it's a string.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moral: don't use <code>(declare (type ...))</code>
          to declare the contract of any API functions,
          it's not the right thing.
          Sure, use it for "helper" functions, but not API functions.

      Use macros when appropriate, which should be sparingly and carefully.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        You must never use a macro where a function will do.
        That is, if the semantics of what you are writing
        conforms to the semantics of a function,
        then write it as a function rather than a macro.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must not use a macro for performance reasons.
        If profiling shows that you have a performance problem
        with a specific function,
        document the need and profiling-results appropriately,
        and
        <code>DECLAIM</code> to that function <code>INLINE</code>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        You can also use "compiler-macros"
        as a way to speed up function execution
        by specifying a source-to-source transformation.
        Beware that it interferes with tracing the optimized functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you write a macro-defining macro
        (a macro that generates macros),
        comment it particularly clearly,
        since these are hard for the uninitiated to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using Lisp macros properly requires taste.
        Avoid writing complicated macros
        unless the benefit clearly outweighs the cost.
        It takes more effort for your fellow developers to learn your macro,
        so you should only use a macro if the gain in expressiveness
        is big enough to justify that cost.
        As usual, feel free to consult your colleagues if you're not sure,
        since without a lot of Lisp experience,
        it can be hard to make this judgment.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must not define new reader macros.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your macro has a parameter that is a Lisp form
        that will be evaluated when the expanded code is run,
        you should name the parameter with the suffix <code>-form</code>.
        This convention helps make it clearer to the macro's user
        which parameters are Lisp forms to be evaluated, and which are not.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to write a macro is the so-called "call-with" style,
        explained at length in
        <a href="http://random-state.net/log/3390120648.html">http://random-state.net/log/3390120648.html</a>.
        The idea is to keep the macro very simple,
        generating a call to an auxiliary function,
        which often takes a functional argument
        consisting of code in the original macro call.
        Advantages: during development,
        you can modify the function instead of recompiling all macro call sites;
        during debugging, you can see the function in the stack trace;
        there is less generated code so smaller memory usage.
        You should use this style unless
        the macro body is simple, rarely subject to change,
        <em>and</em> the macro is used in tight loops where performance matters.
        Think about whether the extra stack frames are helpful or just clutter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any functions (closures) created by the macro should be named:
        either use <code>FLET</code> or <code>NAMED-LAMBDA</code>.
        Using <code>FLET</code> is also good
        because you can declare the function to be of dynamic
        extent (if it is &#8212; and usually it is).
      </p>
      <p>
        If a macro call contains a form,
        and the macro expansion includes more than one copy of that form,
        the form can be evaluated more than once.
        If someone uses the macro and calls it
        with a form that has side effects or that takes a long time to compute,
        the behavior will be undesirable
        (unless you're intentionally writing
        a control structure such as a loop).
        A convenient way to avoid this problem
        is to evaluate the form only once,
        and bind a (generated) variable to the result.
        There is a very useful macro called <code>ALEXANDRIA:ONCE-ONLY</code>
        that generates code to do this.
        See also <code>ALEXANDRIA:WITH-GENSYMS</code>,
        to make some temporary variables in the generated code.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you write a macro with a body,
        such as a <code>WITH-xxx</code> macro,
        even if there aren't any parameters,
        you should leave space for them anyway.
        For example, if you invent <code>WITH-LIGHTS-ON</code>,
        do not make the call to it look like
        <code>(defmacro with-lights-on (&amp;body b) ...)</code>.
        Instead, do <code>(defmacro with-lights-on (() &amp;body b) ...)</code>.
        That way, if parameters are needed in the future,
        you can add them without necessarily having to change
        all the uses of the macro.

        In summary of the article linked above,
        unless you're doing truly advanced macrology,
        the only valid combination in an <code>EVAL-WHEN</code>

        It is usually an error to omit the <code>:execute</code>,

        It is usually an error to omit the <code>:load-toplevel</code>
        (except to modify e.g. readtables and compile-time settings),
        for it prevents <code>LOAD</code>ing future files

        When a generic function is intended to be called from other
        modules (other parts of the code), there should be an
        explicit <code>DEFGENERIC</code> form,
        with a <code>:DOCUMENTATION</code> string
        explaining the generic contract of the function
        (as opposed to its behavior for some specific class).
        It's generally good to do explicit <code>DEFGENERIC</code> forms,
        but for module entry points it is mandatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the argument list of a generic function includes
        <code>&amp;KEY</code>,
        the <code>DEFGENERIC</code> should always explicitly list
        all of the keyword arguments that are acceptable,
        and explain what they mean.
        (Common Lisp does not require this, but it is good form,
        and it may avoid spurious warnings on SBCL.)
      </p>
      <p>
        You should avoid <code>SLOT-VALUE</code> and <code>WITH-SLOTS</code>,
        unless you absolutely intend to circumvent
        any sort of method combination that might be in effect for the slot.
        Rare exceptions include <code>INITIALIZE-INSTANCE</code>
        and <code>PRINT-OBJECT</code> methods and
        the initialization of Quake volatile slots
        in <code>INITIALIZE-RECORD</code> methods.
        Otherwise, you should use accessors,
        <code>WITH-ACCESSORS</code>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Accessor names generally follow a convention of
        <code>&lt;protocol-name&gt;-&lt;slot-name&gt;</code>,
        where an "protocol" in this case loosely indicates
        a set of functions with well-defined behavior;
        a class can implement all or part of an interface
        by defining some methods for (generic) functions in the protocol,
        including readers and writers.
        No implication of a formal "protocol" concept is intended.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if there were a "notional" protocol called
        is <code>pnr</code> with accessors <code>pnr-segments</code>
        and <code>pnr-passengers</code>, then
        the classes <code>air-pnr</code>, <code>hotel-pnr</code> and
        <code>car-pnr</code> could each reasonably implement
        methods for <code>pnr-segments</code> and <code>pnr-passengers</code>
        as accessors.
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, an abstract base class name is used
        as the notional protocol name, so accessor names default
        to <code>&lt;class-name&gt;-&lt;slot-name&gt;</code>;
        while such names are thus quite prevalent,
        this form is neither required nor even preferred.
        In general, it contributes to "symbol bloat",
        and in many cases has led to a proliferation of "trampoline" methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessors named <code>&lt;slot-name&gt;-of</code> should not be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explicit <code>DEFGENERIC</code> forms should be used when there are
        (or it is anticipated that there will be)
        more than one <code>DEFMETHOD</code> for that generic function.
        The reason is that the documentation for the generic function
        explains the abstract contract for the function,
        as opposed to explaining what an individual method does for
        some specific class(es).
      </p>
      <p>
        You must not use generic functions where there is no "notional" protocol.
        To put it more concretely,
        if you have more than one generic function that specializes its Nth argument,
        the specializing classes should all be descendants of a single class.
        Generic functions must not be used for "overloading",
        i.e. simply to use the same name for two entirely unrelated types.
      </p>
      <p>
        More precisely, it's not really
        whether they descend from a common superclass,
        but whether they obey the same "protocol".
        That is, the two classes should handle the same set of generic functions,
        as if there were an explicit <code>DEFGENERIC</code> for each method.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's another way to put it.
        Suppose you have two classes, A and B, and a generic function F.
        There are two methods for F,
        which dispatch on an argument being of types A and B.
        Is it plausible that there might be a function call somewhere
        in the program that calls F,
        in which the argument might sometimes, at runtime,
        be of class A and other times be of class B?
        If not, you probably are overloading and
        should not be using a single generic function.
      </p>
      <p>
        We allow one exception to this rule:
        it's OK to do overloading
        if the corresponding argument "means" the same thing.
        Typically one overloading allows an X object,
        and the other allows the name of an X object,
        which might be a symbol or something.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must not use MOP "intercessory" operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a class definition creates a method
        as a <code>:READER</code>, <code>:WRITER</code>,
        or <code>:ACCESSOR</code>,
        do not redefine that method.
        It's OK to add <code>:BEFORE</code>, <code>:AFTER</code>,
        and <code>:AROUND</code> methods,
        but don't override the primary method.
      </p>
      <p>
        In methods with keyword arguments,
        you must always use <code>&amp;KEY</code>,
        even if the method does not care about the values of any keys,
        and you should never use <code>&amp;ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS</code>.
        As long as a keyword is accepted by any method of a generic function,
        it's OK to use it in the generic function,
        even if the other methods of the same generic function
        don't mention it explicitly.
        This is particularly important
        for <code>INITIALIZE-INSTANCE</code> methods,
        since if you did use <code>&amp;ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS</code>,
        it would disable error checking for misspelled or wrong keywords
        in <code>MAKE-INSTANCE</code> calls!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A typical <code>PRINT-OBJECT</code> method might look like this:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        (defmethod print-object ((p person) stream)
        (print-unprintable-object (p stream :type t :identity t)

        (safe-format stream "~a ~a" first-name last-name))))

        You should avoid using a list as anything

        You must not use a list as method of passing
        multiple separate values of different types
        in and out of function calls.
        Sometimes it is convenient to use a list
        as a little ad hoc structure,
        i.e. "the first element of the list is a FOO, and the second is a BAR",
        but this should be used minimally
        since it gets harder to remember the little convention.
        You must only use a list that way

        The proper way to pass around an object

        The former refers to the function object, as is properly scoped.

        An exception is when you explicitly want dynamic linking,

        Another exception is when you explicitly want to access

        This shouldn't happen often, as it is usually a bad idea
        to shadow a function when you will want to use the shadowed function;
        just use a different name for the lexical function.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must consistently use either <code>#'(lambda ...)</code>
        or <code>(lambda ...)</code> without <code>#'</code> everywhere.
        You should only use the former style if your code is intended as a library
        with maximal compatibility to all Common Lisp implementations.
        Unlike the case of <code>#'symbol</code> vs <code>'symbol</code>,
        it is only a syntactic difference with no semantic impact,

      Common Lisp pathnames are tricky. Be aware of pitfalls.

    <BODY>
      <p>
        It is surprisingly hard to properly deal with pathnames in Common Lisp.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, be aware of the discrepancies between
        the syntax of Common Lisp pathnames,
        which depends on which implementation and operating system
        you are using,
        and the native syntax of pathnames on your operating system.
        The Lisp syntax may involves quoting of special characters
        such as <code>#\.</code> and <code>#\*</code>, etc.,
        in addition to the quoting of
        <code>#\\</code> and <code>#\"</code> within strings.
        By contrast, your operating system's other
        system programming languages
        (shell, C, scripting languages)
        may only have one layer of quoting, into strings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, when using <code>MERGE-PATHNAMES</code>,
        be wary of the treatment of the <code>HOST</code> component,
        which matters a lot on non-Unix platforms.
        You probably should instead be using
        <code>ASDF-UTILS:MERGE-PATHNAMES*</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, be aware that <code>DIRECTORY</code> is not portable
        in how it handles wildcards, sub-directories, symlinks, etc.
        There again, <code>ASDF-UTILS</code> provides several
        common abstractions to deal with pathnames.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, be aware that paths may change between
        the time you build the Lisp image for your application,
        and the time you run the application from its image.
        You should be careful to reset your image
        to forget irrelevant build-time paths and
        reinitialize any search path from current environment variables.
        <code>ASDF</code> for instance requires you to reset its paths
        with <code>ASDF:CLEAR-CONFIGURATION</code>.

      <p>
        You should avoid using <code>&amp;ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS</code>,
        since it blurs the contract of a function.
        Almost any real function (generic or not) allows a certain
        fixed set of keywords, as far as its caller is concerned,
        and those are part of its contract.
        If you are implementing a method of a generic function,
        and it does not need to know
        the values of some of the keyword arguments,
        it is acceptable to use <code>&amp;ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS</code>
        rather than list all the keyword arguments explicitly
        and use <code>(declare (ignore ...))</code> on them.
        (Of course in such a case there should not be a &amp;REST.)
        Note that the contract of a generic function belongs in
        the <code>DEFGENERIC</code>, not in the <code>DEFMETHOD</code>
        which is basically an "implementation detail" of the generic function
        as far as the caller of the generic is concerned.

        You should avoid using <code>&amp;AUX</code> arguments,

        You must not have non-<code>NIL</code> defaults
        to your <code>&amp;OPTIONAL</code> arguments

        and <code>&amp;KEY</code> arguments.

      <p>
        You should avoid excessive nesting of binding forms inside a function.
        If your function ends up with massive nesting,
        you should probably break it up into several functions or macros.
        If it is really a single conceptual unit,
        consider using a macro such as <code>FARE-UTILS:NEST</code>
        to at least reduce the amount of indentation required.
        It is bad form to use <code>NEST</code> in typical short functions
        with 4 or fewer levels of nesting,
        but also bad form not to use it in the exceptional long functions
        with 10 or more levels of nesting.

        You should only use <code>CASE</code> and <code>ECASE</code>
        to compare integers, characters or symbols
        (including booleans and keywords).
        Indeed, <code>CASE</code> uses <code>EQL</code> for comparisons,
        so strings and other numbers may not compare the way you expect.

        You must not use gratuitous single quotes in <code>CASE</code> forms.

      <p>
        <code>'BAR</code> there is <code>(QUOTE BAR)</code>,

        and ditto for the second leg
        (though <code>QUOTE</code> will be caught by the first clause).
        This is unlikely to be what you really want.

      <p>
        In <code>CASE</code> forms,
        you must use <code>otherwise</code> instead of <code>t</code>

    <SUMMARY>
      You should the appropriate predicates when comparing objects.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Lisp provides four general equality predicates:
        <code>EQ</code>, <code>EQL</code>, <code>EQUAL</code>,
        and <code>EQUALP</code>,
        which subtly vary in semantics.
        Additionally, Lisp provides the type-specific predicates
        <code>=</code>, <code>CHAR=</code>, <code>CHAR-EQUAL</code>,
        <code>STRING=</code>, and <code>STRING-EQUAL</code>.
        Know the distinction!
      </p>
      <p>
        You should use <code>EQL</code> to compare objects and symbols
        for <em>identity</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must not use <code>EQ</code> to compare numbers or characters.
        Two numbers or characters that are <code>EQL</code>
        are not required by Common Lisp to be <code>EQ</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When choosing between <code>EQ</code> and <code>EQL</code>,
        you should use <code>EQL</code> unless you are writing
        performance-critical low-level code.
        <code>EQL</code> reduces the opportunity
        for a class of embarrassing errors
        (i.e. if characters are ever compared).
        There may a tiny performance cost relative to <code>EQ</code>,
        although under SBCL, it often compiles away entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should use <code>CHAR=</code>
        for case-dependent character comparisons,
        and <code>CHAR-EQUAL</code> for case-ignoring character comparisons.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should use <code>STRING=</code>
        for case-dependent string comparisons,
        and <code>STRING-EQUAL</code> for case-ignoring string comparisons.
      </p>
      <p>
        A common mistake when using <code>SEARCH</code> on strings
        is to provide <code>STRING=</code> or <code>STRING-EQUAL</code>
        as the <code>:TEST</code> function.
        The <code>:TEST</code> function
        is given two sequence elements to compare.
        If the sequences are strings,
        the <code>:TEST</code> function is called on two characters,
        so the correct tests are <code>CHAR=</code> or <code>CHAR-EQUAL</code>.
        If you use <code>STRING=</code> or <code>STRING-EQUAL</code>,
        the result is what you expect,
        but in some Lisp implementations it's much slower.
        CCL (at least as of 8/2008)
        creates a one-character string upon each comparison, for example,
        which is very expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, you should use <code>:START</code> and <code>:END</code> arguments
        to <code>STRING=</code> or <code>STRING-EQUAL</code>
        instead of using <code>SUBSEQ</code>;
        e.g. <code>(string-equal (subseq s1 2 6) s2)</code> should instead be
        <code>(string-equal s1 s2 :start1 2 :end1 6)</code>
        This is preferable because it does not cons.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should use <code>ZEROP</code>,
        <code>PLUSP</code>, or <code>MINUSP</code>,
        instead of comparing a value to <code>0</code> or <code>0.0</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must not use exact comparison on floating point numbers,
        since the vague nature of floating point arithmetic
        can produce little "errors" in numeric value.
        You should compare absolute values to a threshhold.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must use <code>=</code> to compare numbers,
        unless it's really okay for <code>0</code>,
        <code>0.0</code> and <code>-0.0</code> to compare unequal!
        But then again, you must not usually use exact comparison
        on floating point numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monetary amounts should be using decimal (rational) numbers
        to avoid the complexities and rounding errors
        of floating-point arithmetic.

    <SUMMARY>
      You should avoid unnecessary allocation of memory.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        In a language with automatic storage management (such as Lisp or Java),
        the colloquial phrase "memory leak" refers to situation
        where storage that is not actually needed
        nevertheless does not get deallocated,
        because it is still reachable.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should be careful that when you create objects,
        you don't leave them reachable after they are no longer needed!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a particular trap-for-the-unwary in Common Lisp.
        If you make an array with a fill pointer, and put objects in it,
        and then set the fill pointer back to zero,
        those objects are still reachable as far as Lisp goes
        (the Common Lisp spec says that it's still OK
        to refer to the array entries past the end of the fill pointer).
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't cons (i.e., allocate) unnecessarily.
        Garbage collection is not magic.
        Excessive allocation is usually a performance problem.

    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>
  <STYLEPOINT title="DYNAMIC-EXTENT declarations">
    <SUMMARY>
      You should only use <code>DYNAMIC-EXTENT</code>
      where it matters for performance,
      and you can document why it is correct.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of the <code>DYNAMIC-EXTENT</code> declaration
        is to improve performance by reducing garbage collection
        in cases where it appears to be obvious that an object's lifetime
        is within the "dynamic extent" of a function.
        That means the object is created at some point
        after the function is called, and
        the object is always inaccessible after the function exits by any means.
      </p>
      <p>
        By declaring a variable or a local function <code>DYNAMIC-EXTENT</code>,
        the programmer <em>asserts</em> to Lisp
        that any object that is ever a value of that variable
        or the closure that is the definition of the function
        has a lifetime within the dynamic extent of the (innermost) function
        that declares the variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lisp implementation is then free to use that information
        to make the program faster.
        Typically, Lisp implementations can take advantage of this knowledge
        to stack-allocate:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The lists created to store <code>&amp;REST</code> parameters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lists and vector allocated within a function.
        </li>
        <li>
          Closures.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If the assertion is wrong, i.e. if the programmer's claim is not true,
        the results can be <em>catastrophic</em>:
        Lisp can terminate any time after the function returns,
        or it hang forever, or &#8212; worst of all &#8212;
        produce incorrect results without any runtime error!
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if the assertion is correct,
        future changes to the function might introduce
        a violation of the assertion.
        This increases the danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most cases, such objects are ephemeral.
        Modern Lisp implementations use generational garbage collectors,
        which are quite efficient under these circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, <code>DYNAMIC-EXTENT</code> declarations
        should be used sparingly. You must only use them if:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          There is some good reason to think that the overall effect
          on performance is noticeable, and
        </li>
        <li>
          It is absolutely clear that the assertion is true.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is quite unlikely that the code will be changed
          in ways that cause the declaration not to be true anymore.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Point (1) is a special case of
        the principle of avoiding premature optimization.
        An optimization like this only matters if such objects
        are allocated at a very high rate, e.g. "inside an inner loop".
      </p>
      <p>
        It's sometimes hard to know what the rate will be.
        When writing a function or macro
        that's part of a library of reusable code,
        there's no a priori way to know how often the code will run.
        Ideally, tools would be available to discover
        the availability and suitability of using such an optimization
        based on running simulations and test cases, but
        in practice this isn't as easy as it ought to be.
        It's a tradeoff.
        If you're very, very sure that the assertion is true
        (that the object is only used within the dynamic scope),
        and it's not obvious how much time will be saved
        and it's not easy to measure,
        then it may be better to put in the declaration than to leave it out.
        (Ideally it would be easier to make such measurements
        than it actually is.)

        (we want our code to not be gratuitously unportable).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, you must be careful not to use <code>REDUCE</code>
        in ways that needlessly increase
        the complexity class of the computation.
        For instance, <code>(REDUCE 'STRCAT ...)</code> is <i>O(n^2)</i>
        when an appropriate implementation is only <i>O(n)</i>.
        Moreover, <code>(REDUCE 'APPEND ...)</code>
        is also <i>O(n^2)</i> unless you specify <code>:FROM-END T</code>.
        In such cases, you must use proper abstractions
        that cover those cases instead of calling <code>REDUCE</code>,
        first defining them in a suitable library if needs be.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Avoid NCONC">
    <SUMMARY>
      You should not use <code>NCONC</code>;
      you should use <code>APPEND</code> instead,
      or better data structures.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        You should almost never use <code>NCONC</code>.
        You should use <code>APPEND</code>
        when you don't depend on any side-effect.
        You should use <code>ALEXANDRIA:APPENDF</code>
        when you need to update a variable.
        You should probably not depend on games
        being played with the <code>CDR</code>
        of the current cons cell;
        and if you do, you must include a prominent
        comment explaining the use of <code>NCONC</code>;
        and you should probably reconsider your data representation.
      </p>
      <p>
        By extension, you should avoid <code>MAPCAN</code>
        or the <code>NCONC</code> feature of <code>LOOP</code>.
        You should instead respectively use
        <code>ALEXANDRIA:MAPPEND</code>
        and the <code>APPEND</code> feature of <code>LOOP</code>
        respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>NCONC</code> is very seldom a good idea,
        since its time complexity class is no better than <code>APPEND</code>,
        its space complexity class also is no better than <code>APPEND</code>
        in the common case where no one else is sharing the side-effected list,
        and its bug complexity class is way higher than <code>APPEND</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the small performance hit due
        to <code>APPEND</code> vs. <code>NCONC</code>
        is a limiting factor in your program,
        you have a big problem and are probably using the wrong data structure:
        you should be using sequences with constant-time append
        (see Okasaki's book, and add them to lisp-interface-library),
        or more simply you should be accumulating data in a tree
        that will get flattened once in linear time
        after the accumulation phase is complete (see how ASDF does it).
      </p>
      <p>
        You may only use <code>NCONC</code>, <code>MAPCAN</code>
        or the <code>NCONC</code> feature of <code>LOOP</code>
        in low-level functions where performance matters,
        where the use of lists as a data structure has been vetted
        because these lists are known to be short,
        and when the function or expression the result of which are accumulated
        explicitly promises in its contract that it only returns fresh lists.
        Even then, the use of such primitives must be rare,
        and accompanied by justifying documentation.
