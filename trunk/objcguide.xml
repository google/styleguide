<CATEGORY title="Background">

  <p>
    Objective-C is a very dynamic, object-oriented extension of C.  It's
    designed to be easy to use and read, while enabling sophisticated
    object-oriented design. It is the primary development language for new
    applications on Mac OS X and the iPhone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cocoa is one of the main application frameworks on Mac OS X. It is a
    collection of Objective-C classes that provide for rapid development of
    full-featured Mac OS X applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Apple has already written a very good, and widely accepted, coding guide
    for Objective-C. Google has also written a similar guide for C++. This
    Objective-C guide aims to be a very natural combination of Apple's and
    Google's general recommendations. So, before reading this guide, please make
    sure you've read:
    <ul>

  <p>
    <em>Note that all things that are banned in Google's C++ guide are also
    banned in Objective-C++, unless explicitly noted in this document.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose of this document is to describe the Objective-C (and
    Objective-C++) coding guidelines and practices that should be used for all
    Mac OS X code. Many of these guidelines have evolved and been proven over
    time on other projects and teams.
    
    Open-source projects developed by Google
    conform to the requirements in this guide.
  </p>

  <p>
    Google has already released open-source code that conforms to these
    guidelines as part of the
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-toolbox-for-mac/">
      Google Toolbox for Mac project
    </a>
    (abbreviated GTM throughout this document).
    Code meant to be shared across different projects is a good candidate to
    be included in this repository.
  </p>

  

  <p>
    Note that this guide is not an Objective-C tutorial. We assume that the
    reader is familiar with the language. If you are new to Objective-C or
    need a refresher, please read

<CATEGORY title="Example">

  <p>
    They say an example is worth a thousand words so let's start off with an
    example that should give you a feel for the style, spacing, naming, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    An example header file, demonstrating the correct commenting and spacing
    for an <code>@interface</code> declaration
  </p>

<CODE_SNIPPET>
    //  Foo.h
    //  AwesomeProject
    //
    //  Created by Greg Miller on 6/13/08.
    //  Copyright 2008 Google, Inc. All rights reserved.
    //

    #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;

    // A sample class demonstrating good Objective-C style. All interfaces,
    // categories, and protocols (read: all top-level declarations in a header)
    // MUST be commented. Comments must also be adjacent to the object they're
    // documenting.
    //
    // (no blank line between this comment and the interface)
    @interface Foo : NSObject {
     @private
      NSString *bar_;
      NSString *bam_;
    }

    // Returns an autoreleased instance of Foo. See -initWithBar: for details
    // about |bar|.
    + (id)fooWithBar:(NSString *)bar;

    // Designated initializer. |bar| is a thing that represents a thing that
    // does a thing.
    - (id)initWithBar:(NSString *)bar;

    // Gets and sets |bar_|.
    - (NSString *)bar;
    - (void)setBar:(NSString *)bar;

    // Does some work with |blah| and returns YES if the work was completed
    // successfully, and NO otherwise.
    - (BOOL)doWorkWithBlah:(NSString *)blah;

    @end
  </CODE_SNIPPET>

  <p>
    An example source file, demonstrating the correct commenting and spacing
    for the <code>@implementation</code> of an interface. It also includes the
    reference implementations for important methods like getters and setters,
    <code>init</code>, and <code>dealloc</code>.
  </p>

  <CODE_SNIPPET>
    //
    //  Foo.m
    //  AwesomeProject
    //
    //  Created by Greg Miller on 6/13/08.
    //  Copyright 2008 Google, Inc. All rights reserved.
    //

    #import "Foo.h"


    @implementation Foo

    + (id)fooWithBar:(NSString *)bar {
      return [[[self alloc] initWithBar:bar] autorelease];
    }

    // Must always override super's designated initializer.
    - (id)init {
      return [self initWithBar:nil];
    }

    - (id)initWithBar:(NSString *)bar {
      if ((self = [super init])) {
        bar_ = [bar copy];
        bam_ = [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:@"hi %d", 3];
      }
      return self;
    }

    - (void)dealloc {
      [bar_ release];
      [bam_ release];
      [super dealloc];
    }

    - (NSString *)bar {
      return bar_;
    }

    - (void)setBar:(NSString *)bar {
      [bar_ autorelease];
      bar_ = [bar copy];
    }

    - (BOOL)doWorkWithBlah:(NSString *)blah {
      // ...
      return NO;
    }

    @end
  </CODE_SNIPPET>

  <p>
    Blank lines before and after <code>@interface</code>,
    <code>@implementation</code>, and <code>@end</code> are optional. If your
    <code>@interface</code> declares instance variables, a blank
    line should come after the closing brace (<code>}</code>).
  <p>
  </p>
    Unless an interface or implementation is very short, such as when declaring
    a handful of private methods or a bridge class, adding blank lines usually
    helps readability.
  </p>

<CATEGORY title="Spacing And Formatting">

  <STYLEPOINT title="Spaces vs. Tabs">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use only spaces, and indent 2 spaces at a time.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        We use spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs in your code.
        You should set your editor to emit spaces when you hit the tab
        key.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Line Length">
    <SUMMARY>
      Each line of text in your code should try to be at most 80 characters
      long.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Strive to keep your code within 80 columns. We realize that Objective C
        is a verbose language and in some cases it may be more readable to
        extend slightly beyond 80 columns, but this should definitely be the
        exception and not commonplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a reviewer asks that you reformat a line because they feel it can be
        fit in 80 columns and still be readable, you should do so.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We recognize that this rule is controversial, but so much existing
        code already adheres to it, and we feel that consistency is
        important.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can make violations easier to spot in Xcode by going to <i>Xcode
        &gt; Preferences &gt; Text Editing &gt; Show page guide</i>.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Method Declarations and Definitions">
    <SUMMARY>
      One space should be used between the <code>-</code> or <code>+</code>
      and the return type, and no spacing in the parameter list except between
      parameters.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Methods should look like this:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        - (void)doSomethingWithString:(NSString *)theString {
          ...
        }
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        The spacing before the asterisk is optional. When adding new code,
        be consistent with the surrounding file's style.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have too many parameters to fit on one line, giving each its
        own line is preferred. If multiple lines are used, align each using
        the colon before the parameter.
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        - (void)doSomethingWith:(GTMFoo *)theFoo
                           rect:(NSRect)theRect
                       interval:(float)theInterval {
          ...
        }
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        When the first keyword is shorter than the others, indent the later
        lines by at least four spaces. You can do this by making keywords
        line up vertically, not aligning colons:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        - (void)short:(GTMFoo *)theFoo
            longKeyword:(NSRect)theRect
            evenLongerKeyword:(float)theInterval {
          ...
        }
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Method Invocations">
    <SUMMARY>
      Method invocations should be formatted much like method declarations.
      When there's a choice of formatting styles, follow the convention
      already used in a given source file.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Invocations should have all arguments on one line:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        [myObject doFooWith:arg1 name:arg2 error:arg3];
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        or have one argument per line, with colons aligned:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        [myObject doFooWith:arg1
                       name:arg2
                      error:arg3];
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        Don't use any of these styles:
      </p>
      <BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
        [myObject doFooWith:arg1 name:arg2  // some lines with &gt;1 arg
                      error:arg3];

        [myObject doFooWith:arg1
                       name:arg2 error:arg3];

        [myObject doFooWith:arg1
                  name:arg2  // aligning keywords instead of colons
                  error:arg3];
      </BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>

      <p>
        As with declarations and definitions, when the keyword lengths make
        it impossible to align colons and still have four leading
        spaces, indent later lines by four spaces and align keywords after the
        first one, instead of aligning the colons.
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        [myObj short:arg1
            longKeyword:arg2
            evenLongerKeyword:arg3];
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="@public and @private">
    <SUMMARY>
      The <code>@public</code> and <code>@private</code> access modifiers
      should be indented by 1 space.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        This is similar to <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, and
        <code>protected</code> in C++.
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        @interface MyClass : NSObject {
         @public
          ...
         @private
          ...
        }
        @end
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Exceptions">
    <SUMMARY>
      Format exceptions with each <code>@</code> label on its own line and a
      space between the <code>@</code> label and the opening brace
      (<code>{</code>), as well as between the <code>@catch</code> and the
      caught object declaration.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        If you must use Obj-C exceptions, format them as follows.  However, see
        <a href="#Avoid_Throwing_Exceptions">Avoid Throwing Exceptions</a> for
        reasons why you <b>should not</b> be using exceptions.
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        @try {
          foo();
        }
        @catch (NSException *ex) {
          bar(ex);
        }
        @finally {
          baz();
        }
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Protocols">
    <SUMMARY>
      There should not be a space between the type identifier and the name
      of the protocol encased in angle brackets.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        This applies to class declarations, instance variables, and method
        declarations. For example:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        @interface MyProtocoledClass : NSObject&lt;NSWindowDelegate&gt; {
         @private
          id&lt;MyFancyDelegate&gt; delegate_;
        }
        - (void)setDelegate:(id&lt;MyFancyDelegate&gt;)aDelegate;
        @end
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Blocks">
    <SUMMARY>
      Blocks are preferred to the target-selector pattern when creating
      callbacks, as it makes code easier to read. Code inside blocks should be
      indented four spaces.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        There are several appropriate style rules, depending on how long the
        block is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the block can fit on one line, no wrapping is necessary.</li>
        <li>
          If it has to wrap, the closing brace should line up with the first
          character of the line on which the block is declared.
        </li>
        <li>Code within the block should be indented four spaces.</li>
        <li>
          If the block is large, e.g. more than 20 lines, it is recommended to
          move it out-of-line into a local variable.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the block takes no parameters, there are no spaces between the
          characters <code>^{</code>. If the block takes parameters, there is no
          space between the <code>^(</code> characters, but there is one space
          between the <code>) {</code> characters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Two space indents inside blocks are also allowed, but should only
          be used when it's consistent with the rest of the project's code.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        // The entire block fits on one line.
        [operation setCompletionBlock:^{ [self onOperationDone]; }];

<CATEGORY title="Naming">

  <p>
    Naming rules are very important in maintainable code. Objective-C method
    names tend to be very long, but this has the benefit that a block of code
    can almost read like prose, thus rendering many comments unnecessary. </p>
    <p> When writing pure Objective-C code, we mostly follow standard <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/CodingGuidelines.html">Objective-C
    naming rules</a>. These naming guidelines may differ
    significantly from those outlined in the C++ style guide. For example,
    Google's C++ style guide recommends the use of underscores between words
    in variable names, whereas this guide recommends the use of intercaps,
    which is standard in the Objective-C community.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any class, category, method, or variable name may use all capitals for
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialism">initialisms</a>
    within the name. This follows Apple's standard of using all capitals
    within a name for initialisms such as URL, TIFF, and EXIF.
  </p>
  <p>
    When writing Objective-C++, however, things are not so cut and dry. Many
    projects need to implement cross-platform C++ APIs with some Objective-C
    or Cocoa, or bridge between a C++ back-end and a native Cocoa front-end.
    This leads to situations where the two guides are directly at odds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our solution is that the style follows that of the method/function being
    implemented. If you're in an <code>@implementation</code> block, use the
    Objective-C naming rules. If you're implementing a method for a C++
    <code>class</code>, use the C++ naming rules. This avoids the situation
    where instance variable and local variable naming rules are mixed within a
    single function, which would be a serious detriment to readability.
  </p>

  <STYLEPOINT title="File Names">
    <SUMMARY>
      File names should reflect the name of the class implementation that
      they contain -- including case. Follow the convention that your
      
      project
      uses.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        File extensions should be as follows:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><code>.h</code></td>
          <td>C/C++/Objective-C header file</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>.m</code></td>
          <td>Objective-C implementation file</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>.mm</code></td>
          <td>Objective-C++ implementation file</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>.cc</code></td>
          <td>Pure C++ implementation file</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>.c</code></td>
          <td>C implementation file</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        File names for categories should include the name of the class being
        extended, e.g. <code>GTMNSString+Utils.h</code> or
        <code>GTMNSTextView+Autocomplete.h</code>
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Objective-C++">
    <SUMMARY>
      Within a source file, Objective-C++ follows the style of the
      function/method you're implementing.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        In order to minimize clashes between the differing naming styles when
        mixing Cocoa/Objective-C and C++, follow the style of the method being

  <STYLEPOINT title="Class Names">
    <SUMMARY>
      Class names (along with category and protocol names) should start as
      uppercase and use mixed case to delimit words.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        In <em>application-level</em> code, prefixes on class names should
        generally be avoided. Having every single class with same prefix
        impairs readability for no benefit. When designing code to be shared
        across multiple applications, prefixes are acceptable and recommended
        (e.g. <code>GTMSendMessage</code>).
      </p>
      
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Category Names">
    <SUMMARY>
      Category names should start with a 2 or 3 character prefix
      identifying the category as part of a project or open for general
      use. The category name should incorporate the name of the class it's
      extending.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        For example, if we want to create a category on <code>NSString</code>
        for parsing, we would put the category in a file named
        <code>GTMNSString+Parsing.h</code>, and the category itself would be
        named <code>GTMStringParsingAdditions</code> (yes, we know the file
        name and the category name do not match, but this file could have many
        separate categories related to parsing). Methods in that category
        should share the prefix (<code>gtm_myCategoryMethodOnAString:</code>)
        in order to prevent collisions in Objective-C which only has a single
        namespace. If the code isn't meant to be shared and/or doesn't run in
        a different address-space, the method naming isn't quite as
        important.
      </p>
      <p>
        There should be a single space between the class name and the opening
        parenthesis of the category.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Objective-C Method Names">
    <SUMMARY>
      Method names should start as lowercase and then use mixed case.
      Each named parameter should also start as lowercase.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        The method name should read like a sentence if possible, meaning you
        should choose parameter names that flow with the method name. (e.g.
        <code>convertPoint:fromRect:</code> or
        <code>replaceCharactersInRange:withString:</code>). See <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/Articles/NamingMethods.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001282-BCIGIJJF">Apple's
        Guide to Naming Methods</a> for more details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accessor methods should be named the same as the variable they're
        "getting", but they should <em>not</em> be prefixed with the word
        "get". For example:
        <BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
          - (id)getDelegate;  // AVOID
        </BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          - (id)delegate;    // GOOD
        </CODE_SNIPPET>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is for Objective-C methods only. C++ method names and functions
        continue to follow the rules set in the C++ style guide.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Variable Names">
    <SUMMARY>
      Variables names start with a lowercase and use mixed case to delimit
      words. Class member variables have trailing underscores. For example:
      <var>myLocalVariable</var>, <var>myInstanceVariable_</var>. Members
      used for KVO/KVC bindings may begin with a leading underscore
      <i>iff</i> use of Objective-C 2.0's <code>@property</code> isn't
      allowed.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <SUBSECTION title="Common Variable Names">
        <p>
          Do <em>not</em> use Hungarian notation for syntactic attributes,
          such as the static type of a variable (int or pointer). Give as
          descriptive a name as possible, within reason. Don't worry about
          saving horizontal space as it is far more important to make your
          code immediately understandable by a new reader. For example:
        </p>
        <BAD_CODE_SNIPPET>
          int w;
          int nerr;
          int nCompConns;

        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          int numErrors;

      <SUBSECTION title="Instance Variables">
        <p>
          Instance variables are mixed case and should be suffixed with a
          trailing underscore, e.g. <var>usernameTextField_</var>. However,
          we permit an exception when binding to a member variable using
          KVO/KVC and Objective-C 2.0 cannot be used (due to OS release
          constraints). In this case, it is acceptable to prefix the variable
          with an underscore, per Apple's accepted practices for key/value
          naming. If Objective-C 2.0 can be used, <code>@property</code> and
          <code>@synthesize</code> provide a solution that conforms to the
          naming guidelines.

      <SUBSECTION title="Constants">
        <p>

<CATEGORY title="Comments">

  <p>
    Though a pain to write, they are absolutely vital to keeping our code
    readable. The following rules describe what you should comment and where.
    But remember: while comments are very important, the best code is
    self-documenting. Giving sensible names to types and variables is much
    better than using obscure names and then trying to explain them through
    comments.
  </p>
  <p>
    When writing your comments, write for your audience: the next
    
    contributor
    who will need to understand your code.  Be generous &#8212; the next
    one may be you!
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember that all of the rules and conventions listed in the C++ Style
    Guide are in effect here, with a few additional points, below.
  </p>

  <STYLEPOINT title="File Comments">
    <SUMMARY>
      Start each file with a basic description of the contents of the file,
      followed by an author, and then followed by a copyright notice and/or
      license boilerplate.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <SUBSECTION title="Legal Notice and Author Line">
        
        
        <p>
          Every file should contain the following items, in order:
          <ul>
            <li>a basic description of the contents of the file</li>
            <li>an author line</li>
            <li>a copyright statement (for example,
                <code>Copyright 2008 Google Inc.</code>)</li>
            <li>license boilerplate if neccessary. Choose the appropriate
                boilerplate for the license used by the project (e.g.

        <p>
          If you make significant changes to a file that someone else
          originally wrote, add yourself to the author line. This can
          be very helpful when another
          
          contributor
          has questions about the file and needs to know whom to contact
          about it.
        </p>
      </SUBSECTION>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Declaration Comments">
    <SUMMARY>
      Every interface, category, and protocol declaration should have an
      accompanying comment describing its purpose and how it fits into the
      larger picture.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        // A delegate for NSApplication to handle notifications about app
        // launch and shutdown. Owned by the main app controller.

        If you have already described an interface in detail in the
        comments at the top of your file feel free to simply state
        "See comment at top of file for a complete description", but
        be sure to have some sort of comment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, each method in the public interface should have a
        comment explaining its function, arguments, return value, and any
        side effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Document the synchronization assumptions the class makes, if
        any. If an instance of the class can be accessed by multiple
        threads, take extra care to document the rules and invariants
        surrounding multithreaded use.

  <STYLEPOINT title="Implementation Comments">
    <SUMMARY>
      Use vertical bars to quote variable names and symbols in comments rather
      than quotes or naming the symbol inline.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        This helps eliminate ambiguity, especially when the symbol is a common
        word that might make the sentence read like it was poorly constructed.
        E.g. for a symbol "count":
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        // Sometimes we need |count| to be less than zero.
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        or when quoting something which already contains quotes
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        // Remember to call |StringWithoutSpaces("foo bar baz")|
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Object Ownership">
    <SUMMARY>
      Make the pointer ownership model as explicit as possible when it falls
      outside the most common Objective-C usage idioms.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Instance variables which are pointers to objects derived from NSObject
        are presumed to be retained, and should be either commented as weak or
        declared with the <b>__weak</b> lifetime qualifier when applicable.
        Similarly, declared properties must specify a <b>weak</b> or
        <b>assign</b> property attribute if they are not retained by the
        class.  An exception is instance variables labeled as IBOutlets in Mac
        software, which are presumed to not be retained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where instance variables are pointers to CoreFoundation, C++, and
        other non-Objective-C objects, they should always be declared with
        the __strong and __weak type modifiers to indicate which pointers are
        and are not retained. CoreFoundation and other non-Objective-C object
        pointers require explicit memory management, even when building for
        automatic reference counting or garbage collection. When the __weak
        type modifier is not allowed (e.g. C++ member variables when compiled
        under clang), a comment should be used instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be mindful that support for automatic C++ objects encapsulated in
        Objective-C objects is disabled by default, as described <a href="http://chanson.livejournal.com/154253.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of strong and weak declarations:
        <CODE_SNIPPET>
          @interface MyDelegate : NSObject {
           @private
            IBOutlet NSButton *okButton_;  // normal NSControl; implicitly weak on Mac only

            AnObjcObject* doohickey_;  // my doohickey
            __weak MyObjcParent *parent_;  // so we can send msgs back (owns me)

            // non-NSObject pointers...
            __strong CWackyCPPClass *wacky_;  // some cross-platform object
            __strong CFDictionaryRef *dict_;
          }

    <SUMMARY>
      Comment and clearly identify your designated initializer.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        It is important for those who might be subclassing your class that the
        designated initializer be clearly identified. That way, they only need
        to subclass a single initializer (of potentially several) to guarantee
        their subclass' initializer is called. It also helps those debugging
        your class in the future understand the flow of initialization code if
        they need to step through it.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Override Designated Initializer">
    <SUMMARY>
      When writing a subclass that requires an <code>init...</code> method,
      make <i>sure</i> you override the superclass' designated initializer.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        If you fail to override the superclass' designated initializer, your
        initializer may not be called in all cases, leading to subtle and
        very difficult to find bugs.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Overridden NSObject Method Placement">
    <SUMMARY>
      It is strongly recommended and typical practice to place overridden
      methods of <code>NSObject</code> at the top of an
      <code>@implementation</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      This commonly applies (but is not limited) to the <code>init...</code>,
      <code>copyWithZone:</code>, and <code>dealloc</code> methods.
      <code>init...</code> methods should be grouped together, followed by
      the <code>copyWithZone:</code> method, and finally the
      <code>dealloc</code> method.
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Initialization">
    <SUMMARY>
      Don't initialize variables to <code>0</code> or <code>nil</code> in the
      init method; it's redundant.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        All memory for a newly allocated object is initialized to 0 (except
        for <var>isa</var>), so don't clutter up the <code>init</code> method
        by re-initializing variables to 0 or <code>nil</code>.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Avoid +new">
    <SUMMARY>
      Do not invoke the <code>NSObject</code> class method <code>new</code>,
      nor override it in a subclass. Instead, use <code>alloc</code> and
      <code>init</code> methods to instantiate retained objects.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Modern Objective-C code explicitly calls <code>alloc</code> and an
        <code>init</code> method to create and retain an object.  As the
        <code>new</code> class method is rarely used, it makes reviewing code
        for correct memory management more difficult.
      </p>
    </BODY>
  </STYLEPOINT>

  <STYLEPOINT title="Keep the Public API Simple">
    <SUMMARY>
      Keep your class simple; avoid "kitchen-sink" APIs. If a method doesn't
      need to be public, don't make it so. Use a private category to prevent
      cluttering the public header.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        Unlike C++, Objective-C doesn't have a way to differentiate between
        public and private methods &#8212; everything is public. As a result,
        avoid placing methods in the public API unless they are actually
        expected to be used by a consumer of the class. This helps reduce the
        likelihood they'll be called when you're not expecting it. This includes
        methods that are being overridden from the parent class. For internal
        implementation methods, use a category defined in the implementation
        file as opposed to adding them to the public header.
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
        // GTMFoo.m
        #import "GTMFoo.h"

        @interface GTMFoo (PrivateDelegateHandling)
        - (NSString *)doSomethingWithDelegate;  // Declare private method
        @end

        @implementation GTMFoo(PrivateDelegateHandling)
        ...
        - (NSString *)doSomethingWithDelegate {
          // Implement this method
        }
        ...
        @end
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        Before Objective-C 2.0, if you declare a method in the private
        <code>@interface</code>, but forget to implement it in the main
        <code>@implementation</code>, the compiler will <i>not</i> object.
        (This is because you don't implement these private methods in a
        separate category.) The solution is to put the functions within
        an <code>@implementation</code> that specifies the category.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are using Objective-C 2.0, you should instead declare your
        private category using a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Articles/chapter_4_section_5.html#">class
        extension</a>, for example:
      </p>
      <CODE_SNIPPET>
      @interface GMFoo () { ... }
      </CODE_SNIPPET>
      <p>
        which will guarantee that the declared methods are implemented in the
        <code>@implementation</code> section by issuing a compiler warning if
        they are not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, "private" methods are not really private. You could
        accidentally override a superclass's "private" method, thus making a
        very difficult bug to squash. In general, private methods should have
        a fairly unique name that will prevent subclasses from unintentionally
        overriding them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, Objective-C categories are a great way to segment a large
        <code>@implementation</code> section into more understandable chunks
        and to add new, application-specific functionality to the most
        appropriate class. For example, instead of adding "middle truncation"
        code to a random object in your app, make a new category on
        <code>NSString</code>).

  <STYLEPOINT title="#import and #include">

      <code>#import</code> Objective-C/Objective-C++ headers, and

    <BODY>
      <p>
        Choose between <code>#import</code> and <code>#include</code> based
        on the language of the header that you are including.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When including a header that uses Objective-C or Objective-C++,

      <p>
        Some Objective-C headers lack <code>#define</code> guards, and expect

      <p>
        Standard C and C++ headers without any Objective-C in them can expect
        to be included by ordinary C and C++ files.  Since there is no
        <code>#import</code> in standard C or C++, such files will be
        included by <code>#include</code> in those cases.  Using
        <code>#include</code> for them in Objective-C source files as well
        means that these headers will always be included with the same
        semantics.
      </p>
      <p>
        This rule helps avoid inadvertent errors in cross-platform
        projects.  A Mac developer introducing a new C or C++ header might
        forget to add <code>#define</code> guards, which would not cause
        problems on the Mac if the new header were included with
        <code>#import</code>, but would break builds on other platforms
        where <code>#include</code> is used.  Being consistent by using
        <code>#include</code> on all platforms means that compilation is
        more likely to succeed everywhere or fail everywhere, and avoids
        the frustration of files working only on some platforms.

      Be careful when converting general integral values to <code>BOOL</code>.
      Avoid comparing directly with <code>YES</code>.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        <code>BOOL</code> is defined as an unsigned char in Objective-C which
        means that it can have values other than <code>YES</code> (1) and
        <code>NO</code> (0). Do not cast or convert general integral values
        directly to <code>BOOL</code>. Common mistakes include casting or
        converting an array's size, a pointer value, or the result of a bitwise
        logic operation to a <code>BOOL</code> which, depending on the value of
        the last byte of the integral result, could still result in a
        <code>NO</code> value. When converting a general integral value to a
        <code>BOOL</code> use ternery operators to return a <code>YES</code>
        or <code>NO</code> value.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can safely interchange and convert <code>BOOL</code>,
        <code>_Bool</code> and <code>bool</code> (see C++ Std 4.7.4, 4.12 and
        C99 Std 6.3.1.2). You cannot safely interchange <code>BOOL</code> and
        <code>Boolean</code> so treat <code>Booleans</code> as a general
        integral value as discussed above. Only use <code>BOOL</code> in
        Objective C method signatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using logical operators (<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code> and
        <code>!</code>) with <code>BOOL</code> is also valid and will return
        values that can be safely converted to <code>BOOL</code> without the
        need for a ternery operator.

            Have an instance variable named <var>delegate_</var> to reference
            the delegate.

            Thus, the accessor methods should be named <code>delegate</code>

            The <var>delegate_</var> object should <b>not</b> be retained.

    <SUMMARY>
      Separate the model from the view. Separate the controller from the
      view and the model. Use <code>@protocol</code>s for callback APIs.
    </SUMMARY>
    <BODY>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Separate model from view: don't build assumptions about the
            presentation into the model or data source. Keep the interface
            between the data source and the presentation abstract. Don't give
            the model knowledge of its view. (A good rule of thumb is to ask
            yourself if it's possible to have multiple presentations, with
            different states, on a single instance of your data source.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Separate controller from view and model: don't put all of the
            "business logic" into view-related classes; this makes the code
            very unusable. Make controller classes to host this code, but
            ensure that the controller classes don't make too many assumptions
            about the presentation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Define callback APIs with <code>@protocol</code>, using
            <code>@optional</code> if not all the methods are required.
            (Exception: when using Objective-C 1.0, <code>@optional</code> isn't
            available, so use a category to define an "informal protocol".)
          </li>
